# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 30, 2019 
##### (Continued with Basic JS)

**Today's Progress**: Continued from where I left of in the fall!

**Thoughts:** I continued where I left of with Basic Javascript and using FreeCodeCamp. I said that I will join 100DaysOfCode in september I think put it took me a while to get started with this. But now I am and I like it. Will catch up with my documentation.

### Day 2: January 2, 2020 
##### (Finished Basic JavaScript) 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Basic JavaScript from FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: Have to be honest, it ain't easy but learning a lot by repetition. Looking on "get a Hint" feels sometimes like a failure but after some time well, I am still learning and as I move along.

### Day 3: January 3, 2020
##### (Started ES6) 

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp and I'm at ES6 now, yay.

**Thoughts** Some of the challenges are still hard and using Get me a Hint from time to time but the feeling of cracking it before. Learning to read more carefully will give you the answer.

### Day 4: January 4, 2020 
##### (Finished ES6) 

**Today's Progress**: Finished ES6 challenges from FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: Good recap for me was: Var, let and const keyword.

Doing code everyday helps a lot even if it ain't much some days. To be add I do a course on the side of this for React, and through that course I'm building a e-commerce site. But that is coding a long but still good learning.

### Day 5: January 5, 2020 
##### (Regular Expressions) 

**Today's Progress**: Started Regular Expression from FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: Regex was new for me... let codingRegex = /change/;

Sunday and Christmas holiday is almost over, soon back to full time job and coding on the free time. But today is Sunday so continued with my course and then jumped in to Regular Expressions with FreeCodeCamp.

Getting a hang of it and doing let result = extractStr.match(codingRegex);

**Link(s) to work**: [Regular Expressions: Extract MatchesPassed](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/regular-expressions/extract-matches)

### Day 6: January 6, 2020 
##### (Regular Expressions + Debugging) 

**Today's Progress**: Finish Regular Expression and 

**Thoughts**: /^(?=\w{6})(?=\D+\d{2})/; Is hard to grasp right now. 

I Regular Expressions Finished at freeCodeCamp but long from ready to use it. Moved to Debugging and it was only 12 challenges so went ahead and started and finished that as well. Using console.log to debugg was fun but not the first time I used it. 

let myArray = [1, 2, 3;
let arraySum = myArray.reduce((previous, current =>  previous + current);
console.log(`Sum of array values is: ${arraySum});

Sometimes to find a misspelled or missed '}' can be hard sometimes and I can look forever to find it but I still learned from this passage.  

Now the question is that should I continue with the path freeCodeCamp give me (Basic Data Structures) or?

### Day 7: January 7, 2020 
##### (Basic Data Structures) 

**Today's Progress**: Learning about Arrays [], unshift() pop() push() and others.

**Thoughts** 
Did parts of Data Structures from freecodecamp. Some new some familiar topics. One thing I notice when I code along and trying to be fast, spelling wrong or missing the ({});. 

Below is a challenge, check it out. 


**CodeCopied from freeCodeCamp**

Basic Data Structures: Add Items Using splice()

function htmlColorNames(arr) {
  // change code below this line
    const startIndex = 0; // this is just o show what is done. 
    const amountToDelete = 2;
    arr.splice(startIndex, amountToDelete, 'DarkSalmon', 'BlanchedAlmond')
    // arr.splice(0, 2, 'DarkSalmon', 'BlanchedAlmond') This solves the issue.
  // change code above this line
  return arr;

}

// do not change code below this line
console.log(htmlColorNames(['DarkGoldenRod', 'WhiteSmoke', 'LavenderBlush', 'PaleTurqoise', 'FireBrick']));

### Day 8: January 8, 2020 
##### (Basic Data Structures) 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Basic Data Structures

**Thoughts** 
I do have a long journey ahead and lots of practice case thats when I learn at lest. 

The freecodecamp has a good structure where every sections gets harder along the way. 

Below is the last part of BBasic Data Structures, enjoy.

### Day 9: January 9, 2020 
##### (Sass - FreeCodeCamp)

**Today's Progress**: Started with Sass today. 

**Thoughts** 

I have seen SCSS in a course I am taking but thought I would take some challenges in freecodecamp to get a understanding of it. 

Hopefully some more info of it tomorrow day 10 :-) 

### Day 10: January 10, 2020 
##### (Sass - FreeCodeCamp)

 **Today's Progress**: Continued with SASS

**Thoughts** 

Reading about Sass today to get an understanding. 

Moving on to day 11 :-) Later I will at some good links :-) 





### Day 11: January 11, 2020 
##### (Sass - FreeCodeCamp)

 **Today's Progress**: Finished SASS

**Thoughts** 

Not sure I have much to say about it more then it was hard and not fully grasp it :-) 


### Day 12: January 12, 2020 
##### (React - FreeCodeCamp)

 **Today's Progress**: Started with React @ FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts** 

Good to lay the foundation for React with FreeCodeCamp. 
The courses I have taken so far on React has been good but so far it goes through the foundation of React so fast so it is easy to forget the reason of constructor, super and ReactDOM. 



Does this make any sens: 

class MyComponen extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
     <div>
        //<h1>My First React Component!</h1>
     </div>
    );
  }
};

ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />,document.getElementById('challenge-node'))

2. [ReactDOM, render](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html)


### Day 13: January 13, 2020 
##### (React - FreeCodeCamp)

 **Today's Progress**: Continued with React @ FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts** 

Slowly going through the foundation of React. 

Frustration that it takes long time to get it but repetition is a key. 

### Day 14: January 14, 2020 
##### (React - FreeCodeCamp)

 **Today's Progress**: Continued with React @ FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts** 

Getting the foundation in through. I will see where I'm at day 100 :-) 

class StatefulComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // initialize state here
    this.state = {
      name : "Name"
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};

### Day 15: January 15, 2020 
##### (React - FreeCodeCamp)

 **Today's Progress**: Render State (React)

**Thoughts** 

Looking at this.state and setState.

"React expects you to never modify state directly, instead always use this.setState() when state changes occur."

It would look like something like this. 

this.setState({
  username: 'Lewis'
});
