# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 30, 2019 
##### (Continued with Basic JS)

**Today's Progress**: Continued from where I left of in the fall!

**Thoughts:** I continued where I left of with Basic Javascript and using FreeCodeCamp. I said that I will join 100DaysOfCode in september I think put it took me a while to get started with this. But now I am and I like it. Will catch up with my documentation.

### Day 2: January 2, 2020 
##### (Finished Basic JavaScript) 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Basic JavaScript from FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: Have to be honest, it ain't easy but learning a lot by repetition. Looking on "get a Hint" feels sometimes like a failure but after some time well, I am still learning and as I move along.

### Day 3: January 3, 2020
##### (Started ES6) 

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp and I'm at ES6 now, yay.

**Thoughts** Some of the challenges are still hard and using Get me a Hint from time to time but the feeling of cracking it before. Learning to read more carefully will give you the answer.
