# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 30, 2019 
##### (Continued with Basic JS)

**Today's Progress**: Continued from where I left of in the fall!

**Thoughts:** I continued where I left of with Basic Javascript and using FreeCodeCamp. I said that I will join 100DaysOfCode in september I think put it took me a while to get started with this. But now I am and I like it. Will catch up with my documentation.

### Day 2: January 2, 2020 
##### (Finished Basic JavaScript) 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Basic JavaScript from FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: Have to be honest, it ain't easy but learning a lot by repetition. Looking on "get a Hint" feels sometimes like a failure but after some time well, I am still learning and as I move along.

### Day 3: January 3, 2020
##### (Started ES6) 

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp and I'm at ES6 now, yay.

**Thoughts** Some of the challenges are still hard and using Get me a Hint from time to time but the feeling of cracking it before. Learning to read more carefully will give you the answer.

### Day 4: January 4, 2020 
##### (Finished ES6) 

**Today's Progress**: Finished ES6 challenges from FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: Good recap for me was: Var, let and const keyword.

Doing code everyday helps a lot even if it ain't much some days. To be add I do a course on the side of this for React, and through that course I'm building a e-commerce site. But that is coding a long but still good learning.

### Day 5: January 5, 2020 
##### (Regular Expressions) 

**Today's Progress**: Started Regular Expression from FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: Regex was new for me... let codingRegex = /change/;

Sunday and Christmas holiday is almost over, soon back to full time job and coding on the free time. But today is Sunday so continued with my course and then jumped in to Regular Expressions with FreeCodeCamp.

Getting a hang of it and doing let result = extractStr.match(codingRegex);
