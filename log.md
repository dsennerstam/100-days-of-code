# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 30, 2019 
##### (Continued with Basic JS)

**Today's Progress**: Continued from where I left of in the fall!

**Thoughts:** I continued where I left of with Basic Javascript and using FreeCodeCamp. I said that I will join 100DaysOfCode in september I think put it took me a while to get started with this. But now I am and I like it. Will catch up with my documentation.

### Day 2: January 2, 2020 
##### (Finished Basic JavaScript) 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Basic JavaScript from FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: Have to be honest, it ain't easy but learning a lot by repetition. Looking on "get a Hint" feels sometimes like a failure but after some time well, I am still learning and as I move along.

### Day 3: January 3, 2020
##### (Started ES6) 

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp and I'm at ES6 now, yay.

**Thoughts** Some of the challenges are still hard and using Get me a Hint from time to time but the feeling of cracking it before. Learning to read more carefully will give you the answer.

### Day 4: January 4, 2020 
##### (Finished ES6) 

**Today's Progress**: Finished ES6 challenges from FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: Good recap for me was: Var, let and const keyword.

Doing code everyday helps a lot even if it ain't much some days. To be add I do a course on the side of this for React, and through that course I'm building a e-commerce site. But that is coding a long but still good learning.

### Day 5: January 5, 2020 
##### (Regular Expressions) 

**Today's Progress**: Started Regular Expression from FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: Regex was new for me... let codingRegex = /change/;

Sunday and Christmas holiday is almost over, soon back to full time job and coding on the free time. But today is Sunday so continued with my course and then jumped in to Regular Expressions with FreeCodeCamp.

Getting a hang of it and doing let result = extractStr.match(codingRegex);

### Day 6: January 6, 2020 
##### (Regular Expressions + Debugging) 

**Today's Progress**: Finish Regular Expression and 

**Thoughts**: /^(?=\w{6})(?=\D+\d{2})/; Is hard to grasp right now. 

I Regular Expressions Finished at freeCodeCamp but long from ready to use it. Moved to Debugging and it was only 12 challenges so went ahead and started and finished that as well. Using console.log to debugg was fun but not the first time I used it. 

let myArray = [1, 2, 3;
let arraySum = myArray.reduce((previous, current =>  previous + current);
console.log(`Sum of array values is: ${arraySum});

Sometimes to find a misspelled or missed '}' can be hard sometimes and I can look forever to find it but I still learned from this passage.  

Now the question is that should I continue with the path freeCodeCamp give me (Basic Data Structures) or?

### Day 7: January 7, 2020 
##### (Basic Data Structures) 

**Today's Progress**: Learning about Arrays [], unshift() pop() push() and others.

**Thoughts**

Basic Data Structures: Add Items Using splice()

function htmlColorNames(arr) {
  // change code below this line
    const startIndex = 0; // this is just o show what is done. 
    const amountToDelete = 2;
    arr.splice(startIndex, amountToDelete, 'DarkSalmon', 'BlanchedAlmond')
    // arr.splice(0, 2, 'DarkSalmon', 'BlanchedAlmond') This solves the issue.
  // change code above this line
  return arr;

}

// do not change code below this line
console.log(htmlColorNames(['DarkGoldenRod', 'WhiteSmoke', 'LavenderBlush', 'PaleTurqoise', 'FireBrick']));
